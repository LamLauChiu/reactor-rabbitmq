== Reactor RabbitMQ API

[[api-guide-overview]]
=== Overview

This section describes the reactive API for producing and consuming messages using RabbitMQ.
There are two main classes in Reactor RabbitMQ:

. `reactor.rabbitmq.Sender` for publishing messages to RabbitMQ
. `reactor.rabbitmq.Receiver` for consuming messages from RabbitMQ

Full API for Reactor RabbitMQ is available in the link:../api/index.html[javadocs].

The project uses https://github.com/reactor/reactor-core[Reactor Core] to expose a https://github.com/reactive-streams/reactive-streams-jvm["Reactive Streams"] API.
