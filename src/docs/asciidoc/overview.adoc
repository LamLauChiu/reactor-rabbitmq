=== Project Reactor

https://projectreactor.io[Reactor] is a highly optimized reactive library for building efficient, non-blocking
applications on the JVM based on the https://github.com/reactive-streams/reactive-streams-jvm[Reactive Streams Specification].
Reactor based applications can sustain very high throughput message rates and operate with a very low memory footprint,
making it suitable for building efficient event-driven applications using the microservices architecture.

Reactor implements two publishers https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/api/reactor/core/publisher/Flux.html[Flux<T>] and
https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/api/reactor/core/publisher/Mono.html[Mono<T>], both of which support non-blocking back-pressure.
This enables exchange of data between threads with well-defined memory usage, avoiding unnecessary intermediate buffering or blocking.
