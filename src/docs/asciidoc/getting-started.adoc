=== Requirements

You need Java JRE installed (Java 8 or later), as well as Maven.

You also need to install RabbitMQ. Follow the
http://www.rabbitmq.com/download.html[instructions from the website].
Note you should use RabbitMQ 3.6.x or later.

=== Quick Start

This quick start tutorial sets up a single node RabbitMQ and runs the sample reactive
sender and consumer.

==== Start RabbitMQ

Start RabbitMQ on your local machine with all the defaults (e.g. AMQP port is 5672).

==== Run Reactor RabbitMQ Samples

Download Reactor RabbitMQ from https://github.com/reactor/reactor-rabbitmq/.

[source]
--------
> git clone https://github.com/reactor/reactor-rabbitmq
> cd reactor-rabbitmq

==== Building Reactor RabbitMQ Applications

To build your own application using the Reactor RabbitMQ API,
you need to include a dependency to Reactor RabbitMQ.

For gradle:

[source]
--------
dependencies {
    compile "io.projectreactor.rabbitmq:reactor-rabbitmq:1.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT"
}
--------


For maven:

[source]
--------
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.projectreactor.rabbitmq</groupId>
    <artifactId>reactor-rabbitmq</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
--------
